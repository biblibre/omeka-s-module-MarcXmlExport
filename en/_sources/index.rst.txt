Introduction
============

How does it work ?
------------------

This module produces and exports files in marcxml format from selected resources according to a defined mapping.

Requirements
------------

.. highlight:: bash

The export path is currently hard-coded, so it is necessary to create a directory here ::

mkdir OMEKAS_DIR\files\Marc_XML_Export


Where is the configuration
--------------------------

Actually `Unimarc` mapping is include in this module but you can add your own custom mapping on `module.config.php` file:

:doc:`configuration`

It will then be accessible when the import is created under "Select class mapping" dropdown

`Unimarc` mapping:

:doc:`mapping-unimarc`

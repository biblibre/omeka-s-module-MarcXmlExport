Introduction
============

How does it work ?
------------------

This module produces and exports files in marcxml format from selected resources according to a defined mapping.


Where is the configuration
--------------------------

Adding a custom mapping can only be done via a separate module integrating a mapping.
It will then be accessible when the import is created under "Select class mapping" dropdown
